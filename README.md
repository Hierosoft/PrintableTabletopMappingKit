# PrintableTabletopMappingKit
Create maps for Pen&amp;Paper RPGs or other tabletop games, in economical or fancy styles. This is the tileset (tsx file) and source files for creating the tileset. The tileset is meant to be used in [Tiled Map Editor](https://www.mapeditor.org/).

## Use
* Install Tiled Map Editor
* Open Tiled Map Editor
* New Map
* Open File, choose ptmk-64x64.tsx
* Go back to map tab
* Click the "Tilesets" tab at bottom right
  * click blank square (the "Nothing" square of a terrain type, such as tile ID: 52) that is surrounded by something else
  * Fill the entire map with that tile
* Click the "Terrains" tab at the bottom right
  * Choose the "x on Nothing" or "Nothing on x" where x is anything, and paint as needed to make your level

### Tips
* 1x1 objects such as Pillars and square tables can be placed using the "Tilesets" tab
* To draw 2x2 instead of 3x3, hold Ctrl key while drawing with Terrain Brush.
* Tables that are not just a plain square but fewer than 2 squares in any dimension must be constructed piece by piece using the "Tilesets" tab.
